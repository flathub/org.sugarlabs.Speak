 name = Speak
 summary = An animated face that speaks whatever you type
 description = Speak is a talking face.  Anything you type will be spoken aloud using a speech synthesizer.  You can adjust the accent, rate and pitch of the voice as well as the shape of the eyes and mouth.  This is a great way to experiment with a speech synthesizer, learn to type or just have fun making a funny face.
